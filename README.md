=================================

If you want to create open source projects but don't want to copy paste the
BSD license to all of your .c, .h, and .cpp files when you are using xcode,
then this is maybe the solution for you.

   make one.
2. Copy 'BSD Licensed Files' Folder to that library.
3. Done.

or use 

```mkdir ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ &&
cp -r . ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ ```
